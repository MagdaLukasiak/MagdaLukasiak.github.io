            <h1>Best Lecture.</h1>

            <h3>About the project</h3>
              <p>The SGH student chooses the subjects, instructors and
                arranges the schedule of classes (based on the study guide
                and the information contained therein). This is called semester
                declaration to be completed within strictly defined deadlines.
                It is very important to complete the compulsory subjects for
                a given field of study.<br/><br/>
                The problem to work through is the difficulty that students
                find in choosing the right lecturer and interesting subjects.<br/><br/>
                The assumption of the project being implemented is to create
                a tool to facilitate finding a subject and teacher appropriate
                for the student.

    <p>Most students look for information about the subject and teacher
      before enrolling in it.<br/><br/>
      Over 40% of people have problems finding interesting information.<br/><br/>
      Students are mainly influenced by the opinion of others. They look for
      information on Facebook and in the study guide.<br/><br/>
      The most important for students is: way of conducting classes,
      rules for completing the course, an approach leading to students,
      practical use of the subject

<p>Building the UX strategy, I conducted a SWOT analysis, defined the
  goal using the S.M.A.R.T model and tried to propose solutions through
  Value Proposition Canvas.<br/><br/>
  Then I moved to Business Model Canvas, which I think is a very useful
   tool in creating UX strategies. It combines the conclusions of all
   the methods used.
